theory :
1. How do you create nested routes react-router-dom configuration?
2. Read about createHashRouter, createMemoryRouter from React Router docs
3. what is the order of life cycle method calls in class based components?
4. why do we use componentDidMount?
5. why do we use componentWillUnmount? show with example
6. why do we use super(props) in constructor?
7. why can't we have the callback function of useEffect async?

coding :
1. create class based components
  create 2 class based child components
  pass props from parent to child
  create a constructor
  create a state variable inside child
  use this.setState to update it
  what if there are mutiple state variables 
  write a console.log for each life cycle method
  play with the console logs to find out the correct order of their execution 
2. create interval inside componentDidMount?
  use clearInterval to fix the issue cased by that interval
