we can do everything that can be done with React,  with html, css and js? then why React is required?
  with React developer experience for coding will be easy, and we can make large scale applications, 
  and can show in the browser by writing little code.
  React will make the dom operations super fast.
  React is very good at dom maipulations bcs it has virtual dom.
  reusable components.
  reconciliation algorithm(render cycles are fast)

- folder structure in React?
  there is no particular folder structure its up to u.
  we can do basis on the files usage
  dont overthink for folder structure , u can restructure later.
  dont make too much nesting


- better to keep all the hardcoded data in separate files.
    only the components file u can name starting with capital letter , good practice.
    constants file name with small letter.
    inside constants file better to write all constants name with capital letters in snake case(space with underscore)

- there are 2 types of exports and imports 
  - one is named export and other is default export.
  - default export with file cant be written twice(module cannot have multiple default exports)
  - in named export , we write export before defining the name of the constant.
      (ex : export const name = 'Ramya')

-- React hooks -- is the normal js utility functions(normal js utility functions written by facebook developers)
 -- useState - whenever the state variable updates then react re-renders the component.


 actual dom - which contains tags 
 virtual dom - is the representation of actual dom which is the js object.
 
 Diff Algorithm : fins out the difference b/w the virtual DOM's, the updated virtual DOM and the previous Virtual DOM, then it updates the DOM (UI) for every render cycle.
