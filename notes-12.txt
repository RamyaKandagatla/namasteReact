- redux is a library.
- redux is not the only library that is used to manage the state, we have zustand(explore zustand).
- redux is not mandatory use it when only it is required, all applications which are build with redux can also be build without using redux.
- if u are building large scale application where the data is heavily used, lot of read and write operations are happening place in ur ui application, there are lot of components  and a lot of data is being transferred b/w these components, the application has grown huge then using Redux makes sense.
- if u are building a small app, very small app with few components u dont need redux.
- redux libraries:
 there are 2 libraries that redux offers:
   1.React-Redux
   2.Redux Toolkit

# Redux Toolkit
  https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/quick-start
 - install react-redux and @reduxjs/toolkit
 - build our store
 - connect our store to the app
 - slice (cartSlice)
 - dispatch (action)
 - selector

- where u need to be careful while using redux:
  - when u are using selector make sure u are subscribing to the right portion of the store.

Redx Toolkit(RTK) says either mutate the existing state or return the new state.

- read "RTK query" from documentation - https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/quick-start
