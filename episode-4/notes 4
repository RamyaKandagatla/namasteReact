-- Best way to build app is we need proper planning.

-- props is the short form of properties.
-- properties is the something u can pass to the components.
-- if u want to pass the data dynamically to a component u can pass as props.
-- props is like a normal argument to a function.
-- passing a prop to a component is just like passing an argument to a function.
-- the props in a component is normal js object.

key prop in map function?
key identifies the component which is new and renders only that.
never use index as key react official document itself says that.
best is to use identical key, next is using index as key atleast and not to use key is not good practice.

Map, Filter and reduce???

map which transforms the given array.

filter used to filter the array based on some logic.

reduce is used to iterate over the all elements of array and find out a particular value.
  reduce takes a function inside it and this function takes 2 paramters accumulator and current.
    example : 

        const arr = [ 5, 1, 3, 2, 6 ]
        
        function sumOfArr {
          let summ = 0;
          for(let i=0; i< arr.length ;i++){
            summ+=arr[i]
          }
          return summ;
        }
reduce ex: 
      arr.reduce(function(acc,curr) {
        acc = acc + curr;
        return acc;
      },0)

      0 above is the initialization value of accumulator.
