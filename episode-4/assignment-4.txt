2. is ES6 mandatory for React?
  no, 
  --- with ES6 :
  class Greeting extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
    }
  }
  --- If you don’t use ES6 yet, you may use the create-react-class module instead
  var createReactClass = require('create-react-class');
  var Greeting = createReactClass({
  render: function() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
  });

{Component()} vs <Component/> vs <Component><Component/> -- everything is same

    but without introducing an extra node to the DOM. After compilation, 
    the fragment component does not make it to the DOM—only the children element do.
  -- <></> is the shorthand tag for React.Fragment only diff is with React.Fragment we can use key attribute.
