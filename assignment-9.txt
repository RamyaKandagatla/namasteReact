Optimising our App 

Theory:
1. When and why do we need lazy()?
2. What is Suspence?
3. Why we got this error: A component suspended while responding to synchronous input. This will cause the UI to be replaced with a loading indicator.
 To fix, updates that suspend should be wrapped with startTransition? How does suspense fix this error?
4.Advantages and disadavantages of using this code splitting pattern?
5. when do we and why do we need suspense?

coding:
1. create your own custom hooks
2. try out lazy and suspense
3. make your code clean
