q) what is DOM?
The Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an HTML or XML 
document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM 
represents a document with a logical tree.

-The "cross-platform" or multiplatform software is a type of application / program / software that works on
 various operating systems or devices, which are often called platforms. A platform means an operating 
 system such as Windows, Mac OS, Android, or iOS.

 everything in an HTML document is a "node": The entire document is a document node. Every HTML element is 
 an element node. The text inside HTML elements are text nodes.

- The Dom node manipulation is most costliest o/p on browser.
- suppose there is webpage, adding something in the page and hiding something for this DOM tree is getting changed.
- keeping some nodes and removing some nodes from the DOM is the costliest o/p, all these frameworks and 
  libraries are trying to optimize this.

- "JSX" stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write 
- and add HTML in React.
