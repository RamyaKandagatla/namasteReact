Theory:

1. What is prop Drilling?
2. What is lifting the state up?
3. What are the context Provider and context Consumer?
4. If you dont pass a value to the provider does it take the default value?
 code will break and throws error

coding:

1. practice React Context with code examples?
2. Try out Nested Contexts?
