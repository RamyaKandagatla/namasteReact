npx parcel index.html -- npx is executing the npm package parcel with the source file  as index.html

- Instead of using the npx parcel index.html again and again to start the project, we create a scripts in package.json that will build our project.

- npm run start is same as npm start (start is the keyword reserved by npm)
- npm run build is not same as npm build it is only applicable for start.

- reactdom will convert the react element(which is object) to html and pushes to the browser. will replace everything which are in id=root in index.html.

- JSX is javascript syntax, which is easier to create react elements.
  JSX and react are different, in react jsx is used to make the developers life easier.
  JSX is not html in js, it is html like syntax
  JSX is the mix of html and js (u can write js inside jsx by just adding curly braces {} - inside curly braces u can write js)
js engine cant read the code written in JSX.


- components 
  there are 2 types of components 
  i) class based components : (old way of writing) uses classes in js
  ii) functional components : (new way) is just a normal js function which returns the piece of jsx code.
                             - javascript function which returns the react element.(jsx is nothing but react element)
                             - whenever u are creating a component the name of the component's first letter should be in caps otherwise u will get an error. 

q)what is component composition?
  composing the 2 components into one another.

- in jsx we can have only one root element 
- React fragment -- behaves like an empty tag
   <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> is same <></>


-if you are getting data from api , what if api sends some malicious data
and the attacker runs the js in browser and can know the session,local storage, cookies,read data and can get info about ur device this is know as cross site scripting.
-JSX prevents cross site scripting.
